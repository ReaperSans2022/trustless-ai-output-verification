## 🚀 How It Works

![Decentralized System](https://example.com/decentralized-system.png)

The Trustless AI Output Verification system works by utilizing Solana's blockchain technology to securely store and verify AI-generated content hashes. By leveraging a decentralized network, trust is distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring the integrity of the verification process.

## 🎯 Key Features

🔒 **Decentralized Security**: Your AI-generated content hashes are securely stored on the Solana blockchain, ensuring trustless verification.

⏲️ **Immutable Verification**: Once verified on the blockchain, the content hashes cannot be altered, providing an immutable record of verification.

🌐 **Global Accessibility**: Access and verify your AI-generated content from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Solana**: The blockchain platform used to store the AI-generated content hashes securely.
- **Anchor**: A framework for building Solana applications, utilized for developing the trustless verification system.

## 🌟 How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation (`docs/`) to set up and run the system.
